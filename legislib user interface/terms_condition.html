                    <ol type="A">
                        <li>Informal Negotiations: To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute,
                            controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Legal library agree to
                            first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
                            informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court
                            proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address
                            for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have
                            provided to Legal library . Legal library ’s address for such notices is Legal library Publications and
                            Legal Associates, House- 1/1 B, Block C, Lalmatia, (Behind Genetic Plaza, Dhanmondi
                            27), 1207 Dhaka; Attention: Legal.
                        </li>
                        <li>Binding Arbitration: If you and Legal library are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
                            negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Legal library Service (except those Disputes
                            expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any
                            election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU
                            UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER
                            PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. The arbitration will be
                            commenced and conducted in accordance with the provisions of Bangladesh Arbitration
                            Act 2001. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
                            documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need
                            not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow
                            applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as
                            otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Legal library may litigate in court to compel
                            arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter
                            judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
                        </li>
                        <li>Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution: Each party retains the right to bring an
                            individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on
                            an
                            individual basis in an exclusive jurisdiction of Delhi Courts with respect to any dispute
                            related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s
                            intellectual property or proprietary rights.
                        </li>
                        <li>Location of Arbitration: Arbitration will take place in Dhaka, Bangladesh. You and
                            Legal library agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims
                            proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made,
                            the Courts of Bangladesh in Dhaka will have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Legal library
                            agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
