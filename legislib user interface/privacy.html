                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">General information</h4>
                <p>This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when
                    you visit and use our site, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by
                    Legitquest, in existence now or in the future (“Legal library Services”).</p>
                <p>A “Device” is any computer used to access Legitquest Services, including without limitation a
                    desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy
                    governs your access of the Legitquest Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our
                    Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses
                    described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information
                    described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5" style="text-align:justify;">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">What we may collect</h4>
                <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Legal library Services:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your Information. When you register an account with Legitquest, we start by collecting some
                        personal information, such as your name and email address. We may also receive Personal
                        Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have
                        tried to share content from Legitquest with you or tried to refer Legitquest to you.
                    </li>
                    <li>Log Data. When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its
                        software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol
                        (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, search terms
                        you submit to our website, geographic location, identification numbers associated with your
                        Devices, date and time stamps associated with activity on the website, system configuration
                        information, metadata concerning file you upload to Legitquest’s public platform, and other
                        interactions with the Service.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cookies. We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a
                        small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your
                        registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID
                        cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with
                        the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can
                        instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
                        before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however,
                        you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you create your Legitquest account, and authenticate via a third-party service like
                        Twitter, Linkedin or Facebook, we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists
                        associated with that third-party account, so you can connect with existing contacts from that
                        service who are on Legitquest.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <div class="mb-5" style="text-align:justify;">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Disclosure of your information</h4>
                <p>As a rule, we don’t share your personal information outside the company.</p>
                <p>We won’t sell your personal information.</p>
                <p>We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1)
                    with your consent; (2) to a vendor or partner who meets our data protection standards; or (3) when
                    we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a legal process.</p>
                <p>If we’re going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you advance notice
                    so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited from
                    doing so by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our site
                    that we believe to be improper.</p>
                <p>If we merge with another company such that your information will become subject to a different
                    privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting
                    your account during the notice period.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Changing or Deleting Your Information</h4>
                <p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information
                    provided in your registration or account profile. If your personally identifiable information
                    changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on
                    your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law.
                    For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact
                    privacy@legitquest.in</p>

            <div class="mb-5">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
                    Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
                    provide you services, you may delete your account by sending a request to delete your account to
                    privacy@legitquest.in We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
                    obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we
                    will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be
                    latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.
                    In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>

                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Storage</h4>
                <p>Legitquest uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software,
                    networking, storage, and related technology we need to run legitquest.</p>

            <div class="mb-5">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data security</h4>
                <p>We use encryption to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission
                    over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own
                    risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (like using a
                    strong password).</p>

            <div class="">
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we
                    believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And
                    we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service
                    after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
